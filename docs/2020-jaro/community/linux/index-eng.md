Installation guide for macOS
============================

This guide is **only for Linux**.
You can choose Windows or macOS guide [here](../).

Follow the instructions even if you already have some of the software installed
(including `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Java-Training`). You will not lose any previous `Projects` because this folder is not being erased.
Although, you might want to backup `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Java-Training` to e.g. `Documents` folder temporarily.
All other files and subfolders of `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/Java-Training` will either stay intact or will be overwritten by a newer version of the software.
